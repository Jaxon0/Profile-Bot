# Profile Bot

Profile Bot was created in 2020 by jaxon#6666 on Discord as a public, non self hosted bot. Now, in early 2021, I have chosen to require you to self host the bot. Heres how you do it:

## Prerequisites
- A [Glitch.com](glitch.com) account
- A bot application in the [Developer Portal](discord.com/developers)

## Getting Started

- Copy the repo link and create your project in Glitch
- Go to the server.js file and enter your bot token into "bot-token-here", then choose a prefix where it says "prefix-goes-here".

And you're done! Your bot should come online in your server and you got it!

**This bot is __NOT__ made for public use. If you are found opening this to public, you will face consequences**
